Sure, here's a summary of what needs to be done with the modified code to make it compatible with the AML-S905X Libre Computer Board:

1. **Identify the GPIO Library**: Research and find the GPIO library that is compatible with the AML-S905X Libre Computer Board. This may involve checking the board's documentation, forums, or community resources.

2. **Replace RPi.GPIO Import**: Replace the `import RPi.GPIO as GPIO` line with the appropriate import statement for the GPIO library compatible with the Libre board.

3. **Adjust GPIO Pin Numbers**: Replace the GPIO pin numbers (`RING_PIN`, `BUTTON_PIN`, `ROW_PINS`, `COL_PINS`) with the actual GPIO pin numbers corresponding to the ring signal, button, row pins, and column pins on the AML-S905X Libre Computer Board.

4. **Make Necessary Modifications**: If the GPIO library for the Libre board has different functions or syntax than RPi.GPIO, make any necessary modifications to the code to ensure compatibility.

5. **Test the Code**: Once the modifications are made, test the code on the AML-S905X Libre Computer Board to ensure that it operates as expected and interacts correctly with the GPIO pins.

By following these steps, you can adapt the provided code to work with the GPIO pins on the AML-S905X Libre Computer Board.
